This plugin allows interactive debugging of WooCommerce WC_Orders.

== Description ==

I made this plugin because I was having such difficulty getting my head around WooCommerce Orders
and I needed a way to easily do some interactive debugging.

This plugin lets you enter an order number and then enter any arbitrary PHP code to apply to the order.
